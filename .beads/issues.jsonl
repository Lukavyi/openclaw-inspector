Multiple files can have the same sessionId.\n\n## Proposed fix (option D)\nComposite key: `sessionId:topicId` where topicId is parsed from filename suffix (`-topic-XXXXX`). Topic number = Telegram thread ID, stable across renames/deletes. Base files keep plain sessionId as key. Old progress entries remain compatible.\n\n## Migration needed\nMerge old progress from `~/.moltbot-inspector/progress.json` (359 keys, 37KB) into new `~/.openclaw-inspector/progress.json` (270 keys, 20KB) — rename lost all read marks.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"lukavyi@me.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T09:54:53.760334+01:00","created_by":"Clawdbot","updated_at":"2026-02-02T10:10:08.854092+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T10:10:08.854092+01:00","close_reason":"Fixed: composite progress key sessionId:topicId"}
